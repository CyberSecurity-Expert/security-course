# Security Course For Beginners
This repository contains the index.html file used for my GitHub Pages article.
This article teaches how passwords are stored, ways you get infected with malware, dangerous emails, how to 
stop this invasion of privacy, and more! I reccomend reading the article if you are a beginner and want to learn more about security.
Thank you :)
