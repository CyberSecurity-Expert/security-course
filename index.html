    <h3>Welcome viewer! You will be taking a small security course for assuming that you are a beginner. Enter full screen for the best experience. Let's start!</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Topic 1: Suspicious emails and links</h4>
    <p>Ever noticed a suspicious or strange link that maybe has cloudfront.net or j.gs in it?</p>
    <p>These links are used by hackers or scammers to infect you with malware and steal data.</p>
    <p>Take this email for example:</p>
    <br>
    <em>From: norepl@apple.com</em>
    <p>Hi, 2 packs of airpods are being shipped to 6 Crook Ave, Miami, Florida. Please call 1-800-EXA-MPLE for additional shipping info </p>
    <p>If you did not order this and you think someone has found out your password, please refer to this link: dkpg.cloudfront.net/dj3ruu9/id=649362758/appcasm/</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can see that is shows "norpl" instead of "noreply" at the start. This link also has cloudfront.net inside of it which can be dangerous if used by hackers.</p>
    <p>These types of links can infect you computer with trojans, malware, viruses, URL:Blacklist, URL:Scam, and URL:Phising. You should now be able to identify the links now.</p>
    <p>If you however encounter a url shortener like TinyURL, Ow.ly, or Bitly; be careful and be sure to inspect the link before clicking.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Topic 2: Similar looking domains</h4>
    <p>Sometimes, when you aren't paying attention, clones/similar looking domains can steal your info in one click the second you load in.</p>
    <p>Let's say you want to visit facebook.com. What you really typed: facelook.com</p>
    <p>When you visit facelook.com, it is a similar looking site that is impersonating the real facebook.com in order to steal data.</p>
    <p>If I want to visit some shady site I'll have to use my VM.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Topic 3: Ransomware emails and ransomware on computers</h4>
    <p>So you are scrolling through your junk folder and looking for scammers to annoy. At least that's what I do. Anyways, you come across an email like this:</p>
    <br>
    <em>From: thing@example.com</em>
    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>I am a hacker who has full access to your operating system.</p>
    <p>I have been watching you for a few months (Obviously that's not true) and it is the fact that you were infected with malware through a site you visited.</p
    <p>I can expose everthing you have done on your computer to the public in just one click of a button.</p>
    <p>If you do not want me to expose this, send $500 to my bitcoin address (Some random btc address)</p>
    <p>When you pay, you will never see me again.</p>
    <p>You have 78 (Fake and stupid) hours.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They'll mostly use an anonomyous email address so you cannot track it or report it.</p>
    <p>If you receive an email like this, just ignore it and DO NOT pay him. The ransom doesn't actually have a footage of you.</p>
    <p>Also, ransomware can also be an infection to your computer. For example, you might all of a sudden get a message on you screen that says:</p>
    <P>Your computer has been banned due to violation of terms and policy. To unban, call 1-800-EXA-MPLE</P>
    <br>
    <p>When you call them, they'll just tell you that you have to buy a new computer and they'll make you send money to the scammers instead. Thus not giving you a new computer either.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Topic 4: All Hacking Techniques<h4>
    <p>Say your a newbie, you'll probably wonder how hackers get ahold of passwords or how they get access to your computer.</p>
    <p>Well you see, when you enter a password on a website, the site [USED] to store the password in something called a hash.</p>
    <p>Now, a hash is basically a key or token like ndq3u4890732y8756E. For example, if your password is Password123; it may look like this: 89oyou8y6757ERT8GI2Y7676T&^rt^</p>
    <p>So when you enter your password on the same website, it checks if the entered password matches the hash. If it does, you're in! If not, you have to enter it again.</p>
    <p>So enough with passwords, let's talk about malware injection now. Malware injection is when you click a link or button maybe and it executes dangerous code to your opearting system</p>
    <p>This code will either steal your files and data, delete your files without looking, or allow a hacker remote access to your computer.</p>
    <p>So, if you ever see a suspicious ad or run into a popup that says "Your Adobe Flash Player Is Out Of Date!" just don't... don't fall for it.</p>
    <p>Even Adware like cloudfront.net or Win32:Adware [Sig] as well as todhamilton.pro, they'll just display popup ads infected with malware so they can harm your device.</p>
