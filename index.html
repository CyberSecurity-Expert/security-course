<h1>The Security Project
  by Adam Abdallah</h1>

<p>Security is what keeps all data from being attacked whether it is your own personal files and data to corrupting all system files.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, most forms of security don't keep 100% of trackers away. In fact, hackers are always finding ways to bypass these security features</p> 
<p>Everywhere around the world, people are going out of business all because of stolen data, ransomware attacks, and malware.</p>
<p>Some of these have gotten very severe and to the point where some are physically threatened. This is a major issue.</p> 
<p>So, I've decided to do something about it. I will first let some people know about this message and we'll all go spreading the message around social media platforms, websites, maybe even YouTube.</p>  
<p>Many security tips will be given. We'll also be emailing people and deeply researching about all security issues we can find.</p>  
<P>Please help spread the message and we might just be able to not only help people but even save businesses and lives.</p>
